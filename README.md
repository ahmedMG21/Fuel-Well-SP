## About the Project

### Overview
This project addresses a significant gap in the accessibility of nutritional information for Arabic-labeled products. Utilizing advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology specifically tailored for Arabic nutrition facts images, our system converts image-based nutrition labels into searchable text formats. This innovation aims to enhance dietary awareness and decision-making by providing health-conscious consumers with easy access to nutritional information.

### Problem Definition
Arabic nutrition labels are often presented in image formats, posing challenges for consumers who need to access and utilize this information effectively. Traditional text-based search tools and nutrition apps are ineffective with these image-only labels, limiting consumers' ability to make informed dietary choices.
